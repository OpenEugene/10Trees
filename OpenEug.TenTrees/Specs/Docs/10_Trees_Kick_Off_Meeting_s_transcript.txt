00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Kimberlee Noel: companion here.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
mark: your fancy AI companion.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
rebeccaharmon: Hello!

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Kimberlee Noel: Hi, Becky. Do you prefer Rebecca or Becky?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
rebeccaharmon: Becky's good.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay, hi Becky!

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
rebeccaharmon: Hi, Kimberly! Hello, Mark!

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
mark: Hey, good to see you again.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
rebeccaharmon: You too!

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Kimberlee Noel: Nice to meet you!

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, nice to meet you too. Sorry, I lost that link.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Kimberlee Noel: That's okay, things get buried.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
rebeccaharmon: I get inundated with stuff, as I know you guys do, too, and thenâ€¦

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
mark: You look like you're very comfy in your hoodie there, that's nice.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
rebeccaharmon: I am, I've got my, uh, tie-dyed hoodie on.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
mark: Fancy.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
rebeccaharmon: Some, um, Africanâ€¦ some young African woman made this.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Kimberlee Noel: Oh, nice.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
rebeccaharmon: And I brought it back from South Africa, and I just love it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Kimberlee Noel: It looks comfy, and you look very tropical, Mark.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
mark: That's cool.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Kimberlee Noel: Is thatâ€¦

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
rebeccaharmon: Yes, you do.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
mark: I'm reâ€¦ yeah, I reâ€¦ recently back from Hawaii, and we went to the thrift stores, and I got some shirts.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
rebeccaharmon: Oh, nice!

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
mark: On the cheap, I guess that's the way to do it.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
rebeccaharmon: How was the trip?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
mark: Oh, it was great. Tarn is there. Our son Tarn is there with hisâ€¦

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
mark: partner, Alice, andâ€¦

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
mark: They're being, like, poor students living near the college, andâ€¦

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
mark: But, you know, but they're in Hawaii, so how cool is that? Soâ€¦

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
rebeccaharmon: Really? Great.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Kimberlee Noel: Yeah.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
mark: So, uh, we hung out with them, andâ€¦

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
mark: Jove around the island a bunch, and snorkeled every day, andâ€¦

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
rebeccaharmon: Nice.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
mark: Heather saw turtles 6 times, I think that's her record for her, soâ€¦

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mile.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
rebeccaharmon: Wowâ€¦

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
rebeccaharmon: Beautiful.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Kimberlee Noel: Sounds like you had fun.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Kimberlee Noel: So, umâ€¦

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
mark: Yeah.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Kimberlee Noel: We're finally here to discuss, um.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Kimberlee Noel: This project, um, building this platform forâ€¦

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, countries.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Kimberlee Noel: And, umâ€¦

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Kimberlee Noel: Where should we start?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
mark: Well, we talked about 10 trees in person, and you had some great documents.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
mark: And then Iâ€¦ and then I built a, uhâ€¦

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
mark: Uh, and then I built, like, a broken prototype.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
mark: To kind of give a feel forâ€¦

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
mark: What it could look like as a live site.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
mark: And then Becky gave some feedback on that.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
mark: And I think you've coalesced that into thisâ€¦

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
mark: document.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Kimberlee Noel: Yes.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, she did.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Kimberlee Noel: And I sent that over toâ€¦ so you did receive that, Becky. Great.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
rebeccaharmon: I got it.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Kimberlee Noel: And, um, I'm not sure if Mark had a chance to fully review it before we, um.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Kimberlee Noel: Got into this meeting, so maybe we can go over it now, and just make sure everything, um, looks good on it, and is accurate.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, so I'll just start at the top for the main idea for this project is to build.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, around, uh, build digital forms, um.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Kimberlee Noel: To be used by mentors in the field.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, the mentors collect the data on their smartphones.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Kimberlee Noel: And upload it, um, when connected to a central web-based database accessible.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Kimberlee Noel: accessible to the Tentrees team.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, the admin, project manager, and educator are the ones that can, um, not only view, but download data as needed.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
rebeccaharmon: Correctamundo.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, so I guess we could justâ€¦

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Kimberlee Noel: go down the list here, and Mark, please jump in, um, if we get into the, like, technical stuff that you're dealing with.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
mark: Darn.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Kimberlee Noel: Uh, umâ€¦

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Kimberlee Noel: So, the core components are, um, the users and the devices, soâ€¦

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, from what I understand, you currently haveâ€¦

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Kimberlee Noel: 17 tree mentors, or is that just in oneâ€¦ is that total?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, we're in one village right now with 10 trees.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
rebeccaharmon: And we have 17 tree mentors in that village.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
rebeccaharmon: And then we're getting ready toâ€¦

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, launched this hugeâ€¦

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
rebeccaharmon: Matching Grant Campaign.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
rebeccaharmon: And, umâ€¦

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
rebeccaharmon: The main purpose of that matching grant campaign is to be able to.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
rebeccaharmon: Initiate 10 Trees in the second village we work in.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
rebeccaharmon: And, um, so then there will be, initially.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
rebeccaharmon: Five tree mentors in that village.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
rebeccaharmon: Because we're starting with 55 households.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
rebeccaharmon: And then, umâ€¦

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
rebeccaharmon: we have a third village. We are justâ€¦

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:52.000
rebeccaharmon: This week, finished up a big grant proposal, and if that gets funded, then we'll be moving to a third village, and then there's a fourth village.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
rebeccaharmon: That we're in conversation with. Soâ€¦

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Kimberlee Noel: So it's growing, andâ€¦

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
rebeccaharmon: It's growing.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Kimberlee Noel: Yeah, it'sâ€¦ and it wouldn't really be sustainable to keep.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Kimberlee Noel: Doing the things the way that they're currently.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Kimberlee Noel: Happening with paper and pencil, soâ€¦

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, I see it's important that, you know, we have something that's easy for people to use, and umâ€¦

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Kimberlee Noel: Uh, keeps all the data in one place.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, okay.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, soâ€¦

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Kimberlee Noel: And they're currently using smartphones.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Kimberlee Noel: um, mixed brands, like Nokia or off-brand.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, and those devices are working okay.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, what'd you say?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, umâ€¦

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
rebeccaharmon: They mainly useâ€¦ they don't do any forms on those phones.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, they mainly use them to take.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
rebeccaharmon: photos and upload them to WhatsApp.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
rebeccaharmon: Or we communicate. We have a WhatsApp group for all the tree mentors.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
rebeccaharmon: And we communicate things like.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, if they're having a problem in somebody's household, they would send us a message on WhatsApp for that.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
rebeccaharmon: If we're gonna have a big meeting with the tree mentors, we send out a message on WhatsApp.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
rebeccaharmon: So, mainly what they're using it for in relation to 10 Trees is, um.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
rebeccaharmon: To upload photos, and then communication.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay, butâ€¦

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Kimberlee Noel: The goal is to also be able to fill out forms.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Kimberlee Noel: Using the smartphone? Is thatâ€¦

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
rebeccaharmon: Yes, well, we want them to be able to fill out the forms on the phones.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, and then we upload those to the centralâ€¦

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
rebeccaharmon: whatever you call it, I don't know, I call it database, you might call it something else, but.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
rebeccaharmon: So that we basically haveâ€¦

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
rebeccaharmon: Whatever they've put into their phones, upload it into the main database.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Kimberlee Noel: And the reason we can't really do that in real time is because of theâ€¦

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Kimberlee Noel: Wi-Fi issue.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, um, I mean, nobody out there has.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
rebeccaharmon: um, internet.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm, mhm.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
rebeccaharmon: And so, we buy them a data package every month.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
rebeccaharmon: That's minimal, because all we're really doing is just uploading photos and messages.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
rebeccaharmon: Uh, so they get about a half a gig of data.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
rebeccaharmon: per month.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
rebeccaharmon: Umâ€¦ butâ€¦

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
rebeccaharmon: you know, the only place out in that village where there's Wi-Fi is at our center.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mm-hmm. And are the mentors, do they visit the center regularly, orâ€¦ They do, okay.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah. Well, they have toâ€¦ right now, they have to come turn in their garden assessment.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mm-hmm, mhm.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.000
rebeccaharmon: two weeks. And so it would be the same thing. They would have to come, but instead of having the paper to turn in, they would bring their phone and upload it to.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
rebeccaharmon: you know, theâ€¦ what do you all call it? Is it a database, or is it something else?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
mark: Sure, I mean, we can call it a database. It's basically, it's an onlineâ€¦

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
mark: data. You know, the forms are online, the data's online.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
mark: The tricky part withâ€¦

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
mark: Letting theâ€¦ with having it work offline.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
mark: isâ€¦

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
mark: You know, does that mean we're installing an app on their phone?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
mark: You know, it's almost like you need, umâ€¦

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
mark: an internet connection.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
mark: to even get started, right? Like, to, like, go to the webpage or whatever.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
rebeccaharmon: Right.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
mark: Kind of, once you're on the webpage, we can do someâ€¦

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
mark: You know, hold onto the data locally, you know, upload it sort of thing, butâ€¦

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
mark: It would be reallyâ€¦ it would be reallyâ€¦ it would be really nice toâ€¦ toâ€¦ to just say.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
rebeccaharmon: So you certainly haveâ€¦

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
mark: Weâ€¦ it needs to be online, because it'sâ€¦ to make it, likeâ€¦

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
mark: Install an app on the phone, and sync it up, and all this stuff is, like.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
mark: Just a different level ofâ€¦

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
mark: Having to work with the phones, and, you know, hands-on stuff, and sideloading, andâ€¦

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
mark: So if weâ€¦ if we can have aâ€¦

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
mark: Minimum constraint that says they're online.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
mark: That'll make this a lot.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
mark: easier. So they might have toâ€¦

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
mark: If they have to visit the center to get online, they might still have to be taking some notes.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
mark: you knowâ€¦

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, Iâ€¦ I guess the question isâ€¦

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
mark: Offload somehow.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
rebeccaharmon: If we did it online.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
rebeccaharmon: And they had data, so they could connect.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
rebeccaharmon: to the network.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
mark: Yeah.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, thenâ€¦

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
rebeccaharmon: I mean, right now, they're connectingâ€¦

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
rebeccaharmon: online via WhatsApp.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000
mark: Yeah, yeah, and the amount of data that we're moving around for the forms is miniscule compared to even one photo.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
mark: Right? And so, if they're able to do photos without visiting.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
mark: the center. They're able to do photos in the field.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
mark: They'll be able to do this as well, I'm sure.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay, well, that makes sense.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, and I thinkâ€¦

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
rebeccaharmon: it's possible, I mean, we'll just have to look atâ€¦

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
rebeccaharmon: How much data it's gonna take for them to do this.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
rebeccaharmon: And adjust accordingly.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, right now, I think per person.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, we spendâ€¦

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
rebeccaharmon: Let's see, uhâ€¦

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
rebeccaharmon: It's aboutâ€¦ oops.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
rebeccaharmon: Umâ€¦

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
rebeccaharmon: It's about $3.25 a month.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
rebeccaharmon: Per person for their data.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
mark: Yeah.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
mark: Well, and we can make it, uhâ€¦

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000
mark: Yeah, we've got some tricks up our sleeve, too. Like, you can have them, when they visit the center, tell them to go to the website and.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
mark: log in and get them started, right? What that'll do is that'll put a bunch of stuff on their phone.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
mark: And so when they go to visit the site again.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
mark: It won't be trying toâ€¦

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
mark: get all the stuff. Like, it'll be like, oh, you know, it's like, I got most of the stuff I need, just put in the stuff, and so we're justâ€¦

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
rebeccaharmon: Right.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
mark: At that point, we're just kind of moving data around.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
mark: Uh, not the app, not the UI and stuff, soâ€¦

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Kimberlee Noel: Well, and we can add it to their phone as an icon too, right?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Kimberlee Noel: Hmm. Umâ€¦

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
mark: Turn.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Kimberlee Noel: So, it'sâ€¦ even though it's not an app.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Kimberlee Noel: It wouldâ€¦ there would be, like, an icon that looks very app-like.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Kimberlee Noel: But once they click it, it would just take them to the site, right?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:44.000
mark: Yeah, and everybody's gonna have some sortâ€¦ there's gonna be some sort of onboarding checklist that they need to do, because they also need an account.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm, mhm.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
mark: Right? And so, they need an email address to go with that.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
rebeccaharmon: Right.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
mark: And they need to basicallyâ€¦ they'll probably have to have somebody walk them through getting set up the first time.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
rebeccaharmon: Yes.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
mark: And then once you're all thumbs up, then it's like, okay, don't forget your password, and good luck, you know.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
mark: you know, good luck. And so I think that'll be fine.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, I think that's doable. I mean.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, we're dealing with people.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
rebeccaharmon: whoâ€¦

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
rebeccaharmon: Some people are illiterate in every language.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
rebeccaharmon: We have some people that are literate in Schengen or Sapeti, but not English.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
rebeccaharmon: And then we have someâ€¦ but we've taught them how toâ€¦

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
rebeccaharmon: fill out the forms. You know, you saw the forms are in two languages.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
mark: Yeah.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
rebeccaharmon: And so, we've spent a lot of time.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
rebeccaharmon: Training them to fill out the forms, and they can do that now.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
rebeccaharmon: So it's really just a matter of getting them to be comfortable with.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
rebeccaharmon: Doing those forms on their phone versusâ€¦

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mm-hmm. Well, we'llâ€¦ we'll want to make sure that it's a very, um, visually.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
rebeccaharmon: on a paper.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Kimberlee Noel: Similar to the paper forms, very simple.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, and use all the, you know, same language that they'reâ€¦

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, uhâ€¦

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Kimberlee Noel: That is already on theâ€¦

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, forms, soâ€¦ the only newâ€¦ real new part about it will.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Kimberlee Noel: Be the digital part.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Kimberlee Noel: And, you know, the process.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, of filling out the form.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
mark: Yeah, and there's kind of a couple of different ways to approach the multi-language, uh.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
mark: requirement. One of them is.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
mark: To have a language picker?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
mark: And so, when you're in the app, you, like.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
mark: Poke theâ€¦ typically, it's like a little flag or something, and then you can switch between languages, and all of the text changes.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
rebeccaharmon: Oh. Okay.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
mark: Right, that's one way to do it.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
mark: The other way to do it is, if you know you just want the prompts in two languages.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
mark: We can just make all the prompts.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
mark: in both, right? And soâ€¦

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
mark: it's kind of up to us how we want to do it. One of them would support.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
mark: Doing additional languages.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
mark: Umâ€¦ but, you know, and then people kind of have to know how to change it.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
rebeccaharmon: Oh, okay.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
mark: Right? And so if they seeâ€¦

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
mark: The form, and it's inâ€¦

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
mark: English, they'd have to know, oh, I have to click up here.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
mark: To switch it intoâ€¦

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
mark: what'd you say, Sungali?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
rebeccaharmon: Shangan.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
mark: Shong Gong. And then, uh, anyway, so there'sâ€¦

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
mark: A little bit more of a cognitive load if we use the switcher.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
mark: But it's also more flexible if we wanted to add.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
mark: Any other language, we could add any other language.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Kimberlee Noel: Now, is that something we could also implement in the future? So, like, justâ€¦ if we just start off with the way the forms are now in the two languages.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Kimberlee Noel: Just putting, you know, just so it's a veryâ€¦

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Kimberlee Noel: Familiar experience, and thenâ€¦

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Kimberlee Noel: You know, as 10 trees grow.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Kimberlee Noel: You know, and branches out.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Kimberlee Noel: um, incorporating.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Kimberlee Noel: The more, umâ€¦ or is this something you want to consider from the very beginning?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
mark: It's good to know in the beginning, because it's kind of an either-or choice.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay. Okay.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
mark: Because once we go down theâ€¦

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
mark: It's called localization. Once you go down the localization route.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000
mark: The entire app knows what language it's in, and it actually can detect it from the device.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
rebeccaharmon: Oh, okay.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
mark: And so, if they'reâ€¦ if they'reâ€¦ if they've picked the language on their device.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
mark: We can pick that up.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
mark: And then we can do our best.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:42.000
mark: Uh, to do that. If we always know that we want to show two languages, we basically don't do localization, we ignore what's on the device.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
mark: And we just kind of, like, hardcode the prompts in.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
mark: Right.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
rebeccaharmon: But then, if we move to, like, I mean, 10 Trees is gonna grow.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
mark: Right.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
rebeccaharmon: So, Shangan is the local language in the village that we're in now.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:06.000
rebeccaharmon: But, um, the language over where Londozzi is, I don't think is Shangon, I think it's Sepeti or something else.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
mark: Then we should do localization so that we can.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
rebeccaharmon: That's what I thought, too. So we canâ€¦

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
mark: Yeah, let's doâ€¦ let's do that from the get-go.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
rebeccaharmon: And then it'll also shorten.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
rebeccaharmon: The forms, if there's only one language on the form.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000
rebeccaharmon: two. So, in terms of what they're looking at, they'll see the question with one language, and they'll answer it, versus.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
rebeccaharmon: the English and theâ€¦

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
rebeccaharmon: Sangha, or the Shangan.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Kimberlee Noel: Yep.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Is that right, Mark?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
mark: Absolutely, yeah, because they'll just have the one prompt, and it won't be this slash that, slash, you know.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
rebeccaharmon: I think it wouldâ€¦

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
mark: Uh, theâ€¦ the main thing we'll need is, uhâ€¦

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
mark: We'll do everythingâ€¦

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
mark: Uh, we'll make all the English prompts, the way we understand it, because we're English speakers.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
mark: And then we'll need somebody else to go in andâ€¦

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
mark: you know, uhâ€¦

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
mark: Put in the other prompts, you know?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
rebeccaharmon: Now, I sent Kimberly the form.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Kimberlee Noel: Well, yeah.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
mark: We'll have a tool that'll let you do it.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Kimberlee Noel: We, we, um, we have the current forms in both languages, so it's just any additional.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
mark: Okay, cool.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Kimberlee Noel: um, stuff that would be added that we would need help with the translation. So, we can work with what's currently.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, available, because we do have both languages.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
mark: Great. Yeah, and then testing, of course, too, that's the otherâ€¦

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
mark: gap we have is I won't be able to look at it and know that it's wrong.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, well, we've got peopleâ€¦ Quinton and TriGive can definitely do the testing on it.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
mark: Oh, great. Yeah, we just needâ€¦ yeah, theâ€¦ that's awesome. They just need English and whatever the other language is, so that they canâ€¦

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
mark: To go back and forth and make sure it'sâ€¦

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, and they know these forms inside out, because they work with them all the time, so I don't think it'llâ€¦

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
mark: Right?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
rebeccaharmon: A stretch for them, yeah.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Kimberlee Noel: And so, umâ€¦

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
mark: Great.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Kimberlee Noel: There are 3 main forms, right, from what I understand, with the application.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Kimberlee Noel: Which is the first thing that somebody wouldâ€¦

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Kimberlee Noel: fill out. Umâ€¦

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Kimberlee Noel: The mapping form, and the garden assessment.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, so, in which order wouldâ€¦

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Kimberlee Noel: The mapping form and garden assessment, um, come after the application.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, I'm pulling up myâ€¦

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
rebeccaharmon: That right now on myâ€¦

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
rebeccaharmon: So, we have the application form.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
rebeccaharmon: That's the first one.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
rebeccaharmon: And thenâ€¦

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
rebeccaharmon: Let's seeâ€¦

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
rebeccaharmon: And then we have the mapping form.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
rebeccaharmon: And then there is aâ€¦

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
rebeccaharmon: Umâ€¦

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
rebeccaharmon: release form.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
rebeccaharmon: that they have to sign. I don'tâ€¦ I can't remember if I sent thatâ€¦

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Kimberlee Noel: I don't think we have that one, so, umâ€¦

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
rebeccaharmon: Send those to you. They're not long.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
rebeccaharmon: It's really just, you know, giving us permission to.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
rebeccaharmon: use their photos.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
rebeccaharmon: Umâ€¦ that's all the release forms are, and thenâ€¦

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
rebeccaharmon: Umâ€¦

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
rebeccaharmon: I'm looking at thisâ€¦

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
rebeccaharmon: Where theyâ€¦ yep, they signed that, okay.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
rebeccaharmon: And then the garden assessment would be the last one.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay. Um, so we have the application.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Kimberlee Noel: Form mapping form and garden assessment, so we justâ€¦

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Kimberlee Noel: Need the release form.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, and then they, they take some classes.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Kimberlee Noel: Before? Okay. Andâ€¦

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep. Umâ€¦

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Kimberlee Noel: Go ahead.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, um, we can keep.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
rebeccaharmon: the class attendanceâ€¦

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000
rebeccaharmon: just on an Excel spreadsheet, if we, you know, we don't have to have that in the database. It's really justâ€¦

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
rebeccaharmon: a tool. We keep track of it because they're required.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
rebeccaharmon: To attend the classes in order to get their trees.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000
rebeccaharmon: So, once we getâ€¦ and we also like to keep track of how many people are coming to the additional classes.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, because we give outâ€¦

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000
rebeccaharmon: some awards and have competitions and things like that. But that doesn't have to be in the database in terms of.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, you know, adding it in, because we'd have to fill in a date for each class.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
rebeccaharmon: And, you know, I don't know how difficult that is.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
mark: Well, and we can, you know, it's always good to scope it in a way that will give you the most success.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
mark: And then, if we're successful.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.000
mark: you know, add additional stuff to it. But if the class attendance isn't currently a pain point, because it's all in person.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
mark: Thenâ€¦

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, they all sign a, umâ€¦

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
rebeccaharmon: A sign-in sheet every class.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
rebeccaharmon: And then we go into the masterâ€¦

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
rebeccaharmon: Excel spreadsheet that we have, and we create a column.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
rebeccaharmon: For that class, and then they just get a tick box if they were.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
rebeccaharmon: you know, at that class, or an A if they were absent.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
mark: Yeah, and if that doesn't feel onerous.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
mark: At the moment, you might want to just keep doing that for a little bit.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, we can.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay, so we'll keep that, umâ€¦

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Kimberlee Noel: As it is for now. Umâ€¦

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Kimberlee Noel: And soâ€¦

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Kimberlee Noel: The data that, uh, will be recorded.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, are things like the total trees planted, tree survival rate.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Kimberlee Noel: And use of permaculture principles. Umâ€¦

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Kimberlee Noel: So these things, umâ€¦

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Kimberlee Noel: Areâ€¦ are tracked, and, umâ€¦

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Kimberlee Noel: These are, umâ€¦

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Kimberlee Noel: exported as Excel or CSV.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, does that soundâ€¦

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Kimberlee Noel: Accurate.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
rebeccaharmon: Umâ€¦

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, they are tracked on the garden assessment form.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
rebeccaharmon: And then, umâ€¦

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
rebeccaharmon: Right now, you know, we justâ€¦

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
rebeccaharmon: At the moment, what we're doing, and it would be better if we could do this a little moreâ€¦

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, deliberately. What we do is we justâ€¦ we go along the garden assessment form.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
rebeccaharmon: And we have 5 basic permaculture principles.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
rebeccaharmon: That we want to know if they're using those 5.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
rebeccaharmon: There's some additional things, too, but those are the main five.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
rebeccaharmon: And so then they put aâ€¦

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
rebeccaharmon: There's a thing that says how many permaculture principles are they using?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, 3, 2, 4, 5, whatever.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
rebeccaharmon: But it doesn't tell usâ€¦

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
rebeccaharmon: Unless we look at the paper.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
rebeccaharmon: Which ones they're not using.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
mark: Would we like to know?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, we would, actually. I mean, that's what I say, if weâ€¦ if we had the 5 on there.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
mark: Sure.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
rebeccaharmon: And they could do, yes, yes, yes, no, no, no, whatever.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
rebeccaharmon: And then that could beâ€¦ we could look at that, and we could say, oh, you know, we've gotâ€¦

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
rebeccaharmon: Out of these 210 people.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
rebeccaharmon: Only 50% of them are doing mulching, for example.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
mark: Right.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
rebeccaharmon: And so we know that we need to, like, be really working with people on mulching.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
mark: Yeah, that sounds reasonable. These are just checkboxes.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep, that's all they are.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
rebeccaharmon: And then, you know, weâ€¦ if it can calculate.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
rebeccaharmon: How many they're using out of the five, great.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, how many yeses?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
mark: Yeah, we can do both. We canâ€¦ we can hold on to the number and also theâ€¦ the details.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, theâ€¦ but theâ€¦ actually being able to see which ones they're not using.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
rebeccaharmon: It's like aâ€¦ it's a monitoring tool for us, really.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
mark: Yeah, that sounds good.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mark, I've actually lost my document. I'm having some technical issues at the moment. Umâ€¦

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
mark: Oh, no.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Kimberlee Noel: So I don't know if you have it in front of you to just see whereâ€¦

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
mark: I do, I'm editing it right now.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
mark: I'll just put a note in here, and hopefully you'll be able toâ€¦

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
mark: Know what'sâ€¦ what I'm talking about.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Kimberlee Noel: So I think we have a pretty good understanding of, um, what's needed.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, so at this point.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, I know, Mark, you were working onâ€¦

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, I'm not sure if it was decided if we're fixing the brokenâ€¦

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Kimberlee Noel: Umâ€¦

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Kimberlee Noel: the broken platform that you built, or starting new, I thinkâ€¦ I think we decided we were starting fresh.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Kimberlee Noel: But I could be wrong.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:04.000
mark: Um, it'sâ€¦ Yeah, we didn't reallyâ€¦ we won't really lose anything. There's no sunk costs in that. That was, like, a longâ€¦ that was, like, aâ€¦

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Kimberlee Noel: Right.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
mark: you know, caffeine-addled weekend, you know, like.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
mark: Kind of throw something out there so we had something to hold onto, so we weren't just talking about ideas, you know?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Kimberlee Noel: Right.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
mark: And then, uh, soâ€¦

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
mark: You know, ifâ€¦ if, uh, a lot of that wasâ€¦ was, uh, was good, great.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
mark: Uh, we'll bring it allâ€¦ we'll bring those pieces forward.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
mark: Uh, but I'm gonnaâ€¦ I'm gonna start fresh. Time has passed, there's new versions of things, andâ€¦

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
mark: You know, so I'll start fresh.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
mark: Uh, just cause I don't want to beâ€¦

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
mark: I don't want to be locked into any decisions I made that weekend.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
mark: You knowâ€¦

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:51.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, um, I had a few things that I just jotted down as I read through your excellent summary.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, and I thought maybe it would be a good time to just chuck those out here, since we're talking about the creation.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
mark: Sure.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
rebeccaharmon: So, when we add these villages.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
rebeccaharmon: We want those villages to only be able to see their data.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
mark: Okay, yeah.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.000
rebeccaharmon: So, if Londelozzi's coming on, then we want them to be able to log in and just do the Londelozzi.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
rebeccaharmon: So, each village will have its own separate, kind of.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
mark: Yeah.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
rebeccaharmon: Walls around it, but thenâ€¦

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
rebeccaharmon: At an admin level, we'll be able to see all of it.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
mark: Yeah, admins can see all data.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay. And then, umâ€¦

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, we want to be able to, out ofâ€¦

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
rebeccaharmon: this data. We want to be able to generate reports to them.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
rebeccaharmon: Uh, for us and them, or to funders or whoever.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
rebeccaharmon: And so we would say, basically, to Lundelozzi, okay, well, umâ€¦

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
rebeccaharmon: for the month of November.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
rebeccaharmon: Your tree survival rate was this.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:13.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, and this is how many people were using permaculture principles, and these are the principles that people don't seem to be groking yet, and so we need to do some work with that. And so that Iâ€¦ it's like a carrot to get them to fill out the data.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
rebeccaharmon: Is that we'll be able to generate a report back to them.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
mark: Right.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
rebeccaharmon: And it also helps us to kind of keep the brand integrity.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
rebeccaharmon: Because 10 Trees is our brand, and.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
rebeccaharmon: We have kind of a brand agreement that they're gonna have to sign in order to use the brand.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
mark: Mhm.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
rebeccaharmon: But being able to say to them, you know, once a month.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
rebeccaharmon: We'll generate a report back to you so you could see what happened in this month.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
rebeccaharmon: Is gonna be a big carrot for them toâ€¦

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
rebeccaharmon: Uh, keep their data clean.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
mark: Yeah, and this is the good principles that they're following, areas that could use improvement.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
mark: Treesâ€¦ tree survival rates.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
rebeccaharmon: Yes.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
mark: Stuff like that. Do you have examples of those reports today, or do you do those.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
mark: Like, in an email from spreadsheets or something.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
rebeccaharmon: I don't have, uhâ€¦

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
rebeccaharmon: Examples of those, because.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, we're just keeping all that stuff on an Excel spreadsheet.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
rebeccaharmon: And then, um, and I think I sent you the link to that sheet, Mark.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
mark: Yeah.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
mark: Oh, probably.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
rebeccaharmon: Uh, andâ€¦

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
rebeccaharmon: So then we go through and we justâ€¦

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
rebeccaharmon: Like, for example, if we have a funder, and the funder says, you know, what's your tree survival rate?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
rebeccaharmon: We just go in and look at what we've manually calculated in there.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
rebeccaharmon: And we say, okay, well, you know.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
rebeccaharmon: as ofâ€¦ from June 2023 to current.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
rebeccaharmon: All the trees we've planted, we have a tree survival rate ofâ€¦

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
rebeccaharmon: 91% or whatever it is.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
rebeccaharmon: You know? Umâ€¦

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
mark: Yeah.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.000
rebeccaharmon: So, all of that stuff is just being manually tabulated now out of that spreadsheet.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
mark: How manyâ€¦ and we've gotâ€¦ we're moving into our second village now.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
mark: How many villages are you gonna have inâ€¦

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
mark: 5 years.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, that's a very good question. I don't know.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, I think within the next year.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
rebeccaharmon: We will probably have 4.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
mark: Okay.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, and there's so many things that are sort ofâ€¦

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
rebeccaharmon: In the works right now, we don't really know what's gonna happen.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
mark: Okay.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
rebeccaharmon: There isâ€¦ there's aâ€¦

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
rebeccaharmon: village in the Amazon rainforest that wants 10 trees.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
mark: Okay.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
rebeccaharmon: So, I mean, that's a whole differentâ€¦

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
rebeccaharmon: like, thing. You know, we're talkingâ€¦

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
mark: That sounds very offline.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:52.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, I think it is. Uh, so, but that'sâ€¦ I mean, we need to get these other three villages in our area up and going first.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
mark: Yeah.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
rebeccaharmon: Then we can, you know, entertain how weâ€¦

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
rebeccaharmon: Bring on these places from other countries and that kind of thing.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
mark: Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that reminds me of some, uhâ€¦

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
mark: projects, uh, I was a part of with the Mozilla Foundation, where they were.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
mark: They'd have, like, Raspberry Pis on a littleâ€¦

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
mark: you know, 3D printed thing, and they'd be sending them out into the field, and they'd Wi-Fi, and they'd, you know, like, do all these, like, complicated things to try to.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
mark: Deal withâ€¦ without connectivity.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
mark: Uh, there's solutions to it, for sure, butâ€¦

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
rebeccaharmon: Yes.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
mark: It's, uh, it's a different kind of project.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, it is. Um, and then, whenâ€¦ once theyâ€¦

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
rebeccaharmon: Connectâ€¦ once their garden assessment forms, for example.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
rebeccaharmon: Get moved into the central database.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
rebeccaharmon: Does that data then get deleted off of their phones, or is thatâ€¦

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
rebeccaharmon: I'm just thinking about, as they.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
rebeccaharmon: Log on, andâ€¦ are they gonna have toâ€¦

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
rebeccaharmon: Will all that data have to load for them, or can that beâ€¦

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
rebeccaharmon: Sort of erased, and then they're just loading.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
rebeccaharmon: the form's basically for the current data. Do you know what I mean?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
mark: Yeah, so eachâ€¦ well, we can, uhâ€¦

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
mark: Each time they do a form, we can blank everything out, if it's better to start with a blank form.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
mark: We can alsoâ€¦

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000
mark: You know, jumpstart the form with, you know, whatever stuff we want to carry forward from the last time that they.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
mark: entered it. But if they want to, like, if they wanted to run a report.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
mark: They could. I mean, we could let theâ€¦ you know, it depends on who wants to run the reports. Is this aâ€¦

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
mark: admin-only thing? Do you run the report, you know?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, it is.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
rebeccaharmon: It's an admin-only thing for reporting.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
mark: Okay.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, they don'tâ€¦ I mean, you know, we'reâ€¦ it'll be a big, uhâ€¦

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
rebeccaharmon: stretchâ€¦

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
rebeccaharmon: To get them doing this online.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
mark: Sure.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000
rebeccaharmon: So, if we, you know, we're gonna have to doâ€¦ it was a lot of training just to get them to the point where they couldâ€¦

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, fill out the forms.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
mark: So do you want to, umâ€¦ do you want to help them fill out the forms by, like.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
mark: When they do a new form, pull stuff forward from the previous one, so thatâ€¦

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
mark: They don't have to do quite as much data entry, or you want to blank it all out to make them.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
mark: Type it in.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, I think they would need a clean form.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
rebeccaharmon: With all the questions and everything on it.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
mark: Okay.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
rebeccaharmon: But I'm just thinking in terms of.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
rebeccaharmon: How much, once they log on.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
rebeccaharmon: How much data has to load before they're ready to.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
rebeccaharmon: fill out their garden assessments. I don't know if I'm saying that correctly.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:50.000
mark: Yeah, no, no, it should be nothing, right? Once they log in, they can justâ€¦

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
mark: Do their garden assessment, andâ€¦

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
mark: And if they areâ€¦ have been logged in before.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
mark: It'll just kind of all be there. It'll hold on to a lot.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
mark: Right? Like, it'llâ€¦

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
rebeccaharmon: But it'll go to that individual, so, like.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
mark: Yeah.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
rebeccaharmon: If Bondi's at, you know, Mary's house.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
mark: Yeah.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
rebeccaharmon: She can pull up Mary, and Mary's information will pull up, right?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
mark: Yes.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Kimberlee Noel: Soâ€¦

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Kimberlee Noel: A mentor may be filling out.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Kimberlee Noel: um, severalâ€¦

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Kimberlee Noel: Umâ€¦

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Kimberlee Noel: assessment formsâ€¦

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, beforeâ€¦

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Kimberlee Noel: They even go to the center to upload the data.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Yes, but what Markâ€¦

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
mark: Yeah, so they'll be moving from house to house.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm, mhm. Okay.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
rebeccaharmon: They'll go from house to house.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
rebeccaharmon: And the mostâ€¦

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:51.000
rebeccaharmon: We've got a few tree minters that have 15 households. Most householdâ€¦ most of the tree minters have 10 households.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000
mark: You know what would be nice to hear is the, you know, the day in the life of a mentor, right? Like, what they'reâ€¦

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
mark: What their day looks like.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
mark: They start here, they go thereâ€¦

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
mark: Uh, you know, how thatâ€¦ how that works, because if they're gonna beâ€¦

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
mark: 100% on the phone.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
mark: What happens when they go to one house and there's no connectivity at all? Does that ever happen?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
mark: Maybe, you know.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, the whole network will go down, is what will happen.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
mark: Right, so then their phone's dead.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
mark: And then they'd have to probably do something to fall back to paper.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
rebeccaharmon: I mean, that's what we'd have to do, is have a paper backup.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
mark: Yeah.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
rebeccaharmon: They could bring those to the center.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
rebeccaharmon: And, you know, we'd have to justâ€¦

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
rebeccaharmon: Go in and fill in the forms.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, on theâ€¦

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
mark: And at that point, it's just data entry. So you might actuallyâ€¦ admin folks might.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
mark: Need the ability to use the app as someone else.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, that's right.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:02.000
mark: Right? Like, I'm going to be, you know, mentor, uh, mentor A, or I'm going to be mentor B, because I'm doing data entry for them.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
rebeccaharmon: That's right. Yeah, that's right.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
mark: Okay. I'm gonna make a note about that.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
rebeccaharmon: It's just the network out there is quite unstable.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
rebeccaharmon: And, umâ€¦

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
rebeccaharmon: And so, you know, if there's a big storm, then the network goes down.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
mark: Right.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
rebeccaharmon: you know, it's just, I mean, it's rural.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
rebeccaharmon: South Africa.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
rebeccaharmon: And so, you know, we do the best we can do, but there are days when.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
rebeccaharmon: We don't have any connectivity for anybody.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
mark: Right. You know?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
rebeccaharmon: You can't even make a phone call.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000
mark: And so, is a particular house always assigned to one mentor, or do mentors kind of doâ€¦

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
rebeccaharmon: Now, each mentor has their 10 households.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
mark: Okay.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
rebeccaharmon: And they don't change.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, unless somebody dies, or moves, orâ€¦

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
rebeccaharmon: you knowâ€¦

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
mark: Yeah, that sounds extreme.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, you knowâ€¦

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
mark: Because, you know, we've got similar problems in Lane County when we go out toâ€¦

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
mark: You know, work on the bridges.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
mark: there isn't connectivity, right? So they have to, likeâ€¦ so we print upâ€¦

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
mark: We print up the work orders so that they can go out into the field and still see what they're supposed to do.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
mark: And then, uhâ€¦

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
mark: Somebody's at my door, hold on a second.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
mark: Wanna make sure it's just packages.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
rebeccaharmon: Are you in Eugene, Kimberly?

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Kimberlee Noel: I am, mhm.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Kimberlee Noel: Where, where are you?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
rebeccaharmon: I'm in Portland.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
rebeccaharmon: I've gotâ€¦ I've got friends in Eugene. I'm getting ready to probably make a little.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Kimberlee Noel: Yep.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
rebeccaharmon: Trip down there next week to see them.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
mark: Relax me about.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Kimberlee Noel: Nice.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, I love Eugene.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Kimberlee Noel: I do too.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Kimberlee Noel: How often do you get over to Africa?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, I used toâ€¦

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
rebeccaharmon: be there most of the time, and come back to Portland for, like, 8 or 10 weeks.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
rebeccaharmon: And now I've flipped it, so I'm in Portland, and I go back over there for 3 or 4 months.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Kimberlee Noel: It's a good amount of time.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
rebeccaharmon: So, I'll probably be back over thereâ€¦

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
rebeccaharmon: March or April, something like that.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
rebeccaharmon: Till end of June or July.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Kimberlee Noel: No, perfect. We shouldâ€¦

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Kimberlee Noel: Be able to be testing stuff.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
rebeccaharmon: I know, I saw yourâ€¦

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.000
rebeccaharmon: hoping to have it going by March, and I thought, oh, that'll be good, because then I'll be over there, and we can do the training, andâ€¦

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm. Mm-hmm.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
rebeccaharmon: Actually get people up to speed and make sure.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
rebeccaharmon: It's all going well.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Kimberlee Noel: That's our goal.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
mark: Well, luckily there was nobody real at the door, it was just packages.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
rebeccaharmon: Oh, okay.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
mark: Sometimes they ring the doorbell, I don't know why they do that.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
rebeccaharmon: I know, sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
mark: It's like, just to wake up the dogs, in case they were sleeping.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
mark: Okay, yeah, thisâ€¦ I'm adding notes to the bottom here about the admins beingâ€¦ needing to be able to impersonate.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
mark: mentorsâ€¦

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
mark: Andâ€¦

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
rebeccaharmon: Now, one other question I have is aboutâ€¦

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
rebeccaharmon: The screen sizes of the phones.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
mark: Yeah.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
rebeccaharmon: So, you knowâ€¦

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000
rebeccaharmon: I mean, we have every variety of smartphone that the women have.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
rebeccaharmon: Because a lot of them have their own phones, and we have everything from iPhones.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
rebeccaharmon: all the way to the little Nokia smartphones that are, you know, probably 6 inches.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
mark: Right, well, they have to be aâ€¦

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
mark: Smartphone, so they gotta be able to see the web.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
rebeccaharmon: Right.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
mark: Um, properly a touch screen so they can move between the fields.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
mark: But if you want to send us all the model numbers, you can.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
mark: You know, we'll try and test it on all those screen sizes, because.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
mark: You have to, you know, basicallyâ€¦

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000
mark: it's a combination of the size of the screen and the resolution, too, right? And soâ€¦

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
mark: You know, and we can do our best to make it.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
mark: Fit on everything.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
mark: But there's just, like, physical limitations.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
mark: Uhâ€¦ sometimes.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, I guess what I'm thinking about isâ€¦

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
rebeccaharmon: Whether or not we need toâ€¦

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, set aâ€¦

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Minimum screen size and a minimum resolution.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
rebeccaharmon: That would be necessary for this to work well.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
rebeccaharmon: And then, if weâ€¦

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:50.000
rebeccaharmon: Uh, and brand probably doesn't matter as much as knowing the screen size and the resolution.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
mark: Yeah.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
rebeccaharmon: And then, if weâ€¦

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
rebeccaharmon: Because that would give us some uniformity.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
rebeccaharmon: Across, um, tree mentors, and if we needed to raise money.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
rebeccaharmon: To buy phones for people.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, so that everybody hadâ€¦

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
rebeccaharmon: A screen size that it was at.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
rebeccaharmon: At least this big, and had a resolution at least thisâ€¦

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
rebeccaharmon: Hi.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
mark: Yeah.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
rebeccaharmon: Then, umâ€¦

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
rebeccaharmon: Because, you know, people over there, they have no money. I mean.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.000
rebeccaharmon: Allâ€¦ almost all the people we work with are well below extreme poverty.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
mark: Right.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
rebeccaharmon: So we're talking aboutâ€¦

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
mark: Yeah.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
rebeccaharmon: People living on $30 a month.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
rebeccaharmon: And so, umâ€¦

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:45.000
rebeccaharmon: If they manage to sell some produce or something like that, and they save up money, well, then they're gonna buy the cheapest smartphone that they can buy, because that's justâ€¦

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
rebeccaharmon: That's all they can do.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
mark: Yeah, and I didn't know whatâ€¦ I'm only familiar with, like, the North American market.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
rebeccaharmon: Soâ€¦

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
mark: Um, I'm assuming that there'sâ€¦

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
mark: all those phones are gonna be, like, Android phones, the cheap ones.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, the cheap ones areâ€¦ they're mostly Androids.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
mark: Andâ€¦

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
mark: I could do some research and see what's, you know, what's popular.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
rebeccaharmon: The, the moreâ€¦ the popular brands over there.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
mark: in the effort.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
rebeccaharmon: areâ€¦ Samsung.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
mark: Yeah.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
rebeccaharmon: Ooh, why?

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
rebeccaharmon: Nokiaâ€¦

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
rebeccaharmon: Umâ€¦ and then there's someâ€¦

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
rebeccaharmon: Kind of weird, off-brand things.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, I think most of our team now.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
rebeccaharmon: like, Quentin andâ€¦

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
rebeccaharmon: try-give, uh, 3 or 4 of us have iPhones.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, but that's ourâ€¦ that's our staff, not the tree mentors. I don't thinkâ€¦

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
rebeccaharmon: Any of the tree mentors have an iPhone.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:55.000
mark: And are thoseâ€¦ we used to test on the iPhone SE, because it was, like, the smallest iPhone screen.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
rebeccaharmon: Right.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
mark: Um, it's pretty small.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, it is.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
mark: Target, are you guys using iPhone SEs, or, like, a regular-sized iPhone?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
rebeccaharmon: I think they're usingâ€¦ like, I have an iPhone 13.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
mark: Okay.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
rebeccaharmon: And that's what Tri just bought.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
mark: Okay.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000
rebeccaharmon: And I'm not sure which one Quintin's is, but it's probably somewhere around the size of a 13.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
mark: Yeah, I think they stopped making the SE.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
mark: Soâ€¦

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
mark: Yeah, I just have to figure out whatâ€¦

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:32.000
mark: what screensâ€¦ basically, you're asking me a question I don't know the answer to, which is, like, what's theâ€¦ what's the size of the screen? What resolution?

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
mark: is, like, the bare minimum. And soâ€¦

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
rebeccaharmon: That's what I need, yeah.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
mark: Yeah, so I'm gonna try to seeâ€¦

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.000
mark: I'm gonna try to do a little bit of research. There's, like, a bell curve of, you know, in different markets of what.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
mark: Phones are popular, and you try to hit for the middle of the.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:56.000
mark: you know, bell curve, so I'll have to do a little bit of research to see what's going on there. And thenâ€¦

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
mark: you know, Samsung will have certainâ€¦

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000
mark: models that they sell in North America that they don't sell in Africa, that they don't, you know, and they do sell in India, soâ€¦

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
rebeccaharmon: That's right.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
rebeccaharmon: That's right.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
mark: Um, we'll have to see what's going on there.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
rebeccaharmon: But I can probablyâ€¦

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
rebeccaharmon: like, getâ€¦ try-give toâ€¦ there's a store, a chain of stores there called PEP.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
rebeccaharmon: And a lot of people buy their phones at PEP because they're cheaper.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
rebeccaharmon: And so I could probably get him to go to PEP.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
rebeccaharmon: And take some photos.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
rebeccaharmon: of the falls.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
mark: Yeah, the popular phones, yeah, totally.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
rebeccaharmon: And the price points of them, and then at least you'd be able to see.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
rebeccaharmon: Kind of what model numbers they are, and what brands they are.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
mark: Yeah, because I was surprised, really. I was working with a team that wasâ€¦

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
mark: getting, uhâ€¦

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:58.000
mark: cell phones in the hands of homeless folks in Eugene, and I was totally surprised at the size and the resolution of the screens that they were able to hand out.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
rebeccaharmon: Mm.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:13.000
mark: Yeah, because they'reâ€¦ anyway, they seem capable, like, more capable than I would have expected, so hopefully, maybe we'll get a nice surprise when he takes some pictures, and I can look those up, maybe.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
mark: Maybe things are better than we think they are.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay, well, I hope so. But anyway, that wasâ€¦ that was my last thing that I hadâ€¦

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000
rebeccaharmon: written down there, because I just want to make sure that.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, we haveâ€¦

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
rebeccaharmon: The right tools for them.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
rebeccaharmon: It's gonna be challenging enough to get them on thisâ€¦

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Using this, but if we have the wrong tools for them, then it'sâ€¦

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
rebeccaharmon: It'll be impossible, you know?

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Kimberlee Noel: Yeah.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
mark: Right.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
mark: Yeah, you only getâ€¦ you only get, uhâ€¦

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
mark: You know, one chance for somebody to think it's okay.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
mark: Right? Like, you know, it's hard, it's hard if it's justâ€¦

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
rebeccaharmon: Right.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
mark: totally unworkable. It's really hard to ask them to.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
rebeccaharmon: Oh, I see you got that, Kimberly.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
mark: Try it again, again.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
rebeccaharmon: You put that in there.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Kimberlee Noel: Yeah, I found their website, soâ€¦

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
rebeccaharmon: Excellent. Well, that gives you a really good idea of.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
rebeccaharmon: Kind of the main brands and things that people are buying there.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:12.000
rebeccaharmon: And the rand is somewhereâ€¦ I usually, right now, I calculate about 17 rand to the dollar.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.000
rebeccaharmon: so you can see, I mean, you can go into the currency converter, but I think if you use 17.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
rebeccaharmon: Sometimes it's 17 and a half, sometimes it's 18.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
rebeccaharmon: But that'll give you an idea of what the cost is if you use 17 to the dollar.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
mark: Okay.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah. And then if we need toâ€¦

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
rebeccaharmon: Buy phones for people.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, we can just do a little campaign and say to people.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:47.000
rebeccaharmon: you know, $20 will buy a phone for somebody that needs, you know, one of the tree mentors, andâ€¦

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
rebeccaharmon: Just have, like, aâ€¦

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
rebeccaharmon: a pain.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
mark: Yeah, we could even do a campaign here for that, right?

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, we could, that's what I'm saying, andâ€¦

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
mark: Yeah.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:04.000
rebeccaharmon: say, you know, here's Tondi, want to buy Tondi a phone? $25, or whatever it is, and then it shows Tondi got her phone, you know.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
mark: Yeah.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:14.000
rebeccaharmon: Here's Gracious, okay, buy a phone for Gracious, here's 25 bucks for Gracious's phone. I don't think it would be that difficult to get people to donate for the phones.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
mark: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
mark: The onlyâ€¦ I'm ready to get, uh, going on this one. Theâ€¦

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
mark: One part of it I'm a little light on is.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000
mark: The, uh, the exact details of the reports.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:37.000
mark: And so, kind of my escape hatch on that is you'll be able to download everything as a spreadsheet.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
mark: So that you can, you know, do the reporting you need.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
mark: But I think that thereâ€¦ I think when we initially launched this.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000
mark: The reports are gonna be eitherâ€¦

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
mark: Light, or kindaâ€¦

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
mark: Non-existent, and we'll have to work with it.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.000
mark: We'll have to go through an iteration of, like, okay, great, this is what I really need the report to look like.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
mark: And then we'llâ€¦ we'll come back and do some more, so I just wannaâ€¦

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
rebeccaharmon: Yup.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
mark: Sit, set that up front.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.000
mark: The reports are vague. A lot of the other stuff seems pretty well understood as far as the input of the data.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
rebeccaharmon: Right.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
mark: The output of the data is still a little light on, soâ€¦

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, I don't think about that too, Mark.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, and I can talk toâ€¦

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
rebeccaharmon: one of our sites, like Galondolozzi, I could talk to Jessica and say.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, what would you like to have come back to you?

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, what would be useful to you when weâ€¦ when we report to you?

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
mark: Yeah, and they can even draw pictures, and, you know, it's like, I need a thing like this, andâ€¦

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000
mark: You know, just draw it on a page, like, this would be really useful, you know, and justâ€¦

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
mark: Um, because we can make PDFs, and we can doâ€¦

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000
mark: We can do stuff. It's not the capability, it's knowing what to produce.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
rebeccaharmon: Right, I gotcha.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
mark: But you'll always be able to get to the spreadsheet, so that's nice.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay, good.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
rebeccaharmon: And, um, when we hang up, Kimberly, I'll send the release form.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
rebeccaharmon: That's in two languages to you.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Kimberlee Noel: Perfect. Yeah, because I think we have everything else, soâ€¦

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
rebeccaharmon: So you haveâ€¦

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
rebeccaharmon: And I'll lookâ€¦ I'll double check and make sure that.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
rebeccaharmon: You have everything.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
mark: Yeah, I was just gonna say, now's a good time to send the whole packet.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
rebeccaharmon: Yep.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000
mark: Like, here's, like, here's the latest of absolutely everything we've got.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay, I can do that.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
mark: Um, and a lot of it might be duplicative, but it's nice.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
rebeccaharmon: I'll send you the whole packet.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
mark: Send us the wholeâ€¦ the whole thing, yeah.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Kimberlee Noel: Sounds good.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
rebeccaharmon: Will do.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
mark: That way we can double-check everything.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Kimberlee Noel: Alright, well, I feel, umâ€¦

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Kimberlee Noel: That we're in a good spot.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
rebeccaharmon: No, do you guysâ€¦

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
mark: I feel kicked off.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
rebeccaharmon: You guys need some money soon? Whenâ€¦ you knowâ€¦

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Kimberlee Noel: Uh, whenâ€¦ when would it be better for, um, you?

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
rebeccaharmon: Honey.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Kimberlee Noel: Umâ€¦

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
rebeccaharmon: Well, here's what I'm thinking about, is, umâ€¦

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000
rebeccaharmon: You know, we're getting ready to do thisâ€¦

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
rebeccaharmon: Matching Grant Campaign for 10 Trees.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:19.000
rebeccaharmon: And most of those donations are going to come through, um, either PayPal on our site.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
rebeccaharmon: Or they're gonna come throughâ€¦

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
rebeccaharmon: Project Biome.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
rebeccaharmon: Who's our partner in this.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:34.000
rebeccaharmon: is setting up the whole campaign, and they have the campaign through some classy website? I don't know what it is.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000
rebeccaharmon: Uh, so the donations will either go to them, they're a U.S.-based nonprofit.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
rebeccaharmon: Or they will come to us.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
rebeccaharmon: via our PayPal account in the U.S.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
rebeccaharmon: And so, we couldâ€¦

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
rebeccaharmon: We could send you money from our U.S. PayPal account.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:04.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, or we could have Project Biome send you money once we start getting money in from the matching grant campaign.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
rebeccaharmon: And that's gonna happen within the next couple weeks.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
mark: Well, yeah, and we can send you an invoice for, like, the first third of it, or something.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, why don't you do that?

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay, I'll do that.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:20.000
mark: And then you canâ€¦ whoever can figure out how to pay it online, they can figure out how to pay it online.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000
mark: And, uh, that way, that sounds a little bit less complicated.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay, yeah, I just know that, like.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
rebeccaharmon: to try to get money from our South African bank account to you isâ€¦

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
rebeccaharmon: near impossible.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
mark: Yeah.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:40.000
rebeccaharmon: I mean, the banks over there justâ€¦ they just don'tâ€¦ it's justâ€¦

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:49.000
rebeccaharmon: we'veâ€¦ we've tried many times, and it just doesn't work. But we do get monthly donations into ourâ€¦

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
mark: Yeah.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
rebeccaharmon: um, PayPal account, and if people are gonna donate off our website.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
rebeccaharmon: That'll come into our PayPal account.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.000
rebeccaharmon: And so then we can just generate a payment for you from PayPal.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
mark: Okay, cool.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
rebeccaharmon: into your backup account.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:12.000
mark: Yeah, and weâ€¦ yeah, we usually just do it in thirds. We do it, like, a third to start, a third at some major milestone, and, like, a third at the end, or something.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay. Well, you just let me know, and then I will figure out.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
rebeccaharmon: How to get the money to you.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
mark: Okay.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Kimberlee Noel: That sounds good. I'll send an invoice over.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
rebeccaharmon: Okay. Great.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, by the end of this week.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Kimberlee Noel: Okay.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
rebeccaharmon: Oh, I just want to say one thing.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
rebeccaharmon: I'm immensely grateful.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
rebeccaharmon: To you all for taking this project on.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
rebeccaharmon: And, umâ€¦

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
rebeccaharmon: I wish I could share, like.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
rebeccaharmon: Even 10% of the stories with you.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
rebeccaharmon: about the impact that 10 Trees is having.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
rebeccaharmon: Butâ€¦ and I don't say this lightly because, you know, I'm old.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000
rebeccaharmon: And I've been working in human services for 40 years.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000
rebeccaharmon: But this program is life-changing for people.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
rebeccaharmon: And when you look atâ€¦

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:15.000
rebeccaharmon: women in rural South Africa, they're at the bottom of the food chain. There's only two groups of people that are below rural women on the food chain, and that's people with disabilities who are in rural areas, and orphan children.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
rebeccaharmon: But other than that, rural women.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000
rebeccaharmon: Theyâ€¦ and especially where we work, there's nobody else out there working.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
rebeccaharmon: But the model that we use, and the way that we approach our work with people.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000
rebeccaharmon: Itâ€¦ their lives change in ways that are way beyond just being able to grow food.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
rebeccaharmon: Um, and soâ€¦

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:48.000
rebeccaharmon: I have no problem, like, asking people for money for our programs, because I see what they're doing, and I see the impact that they're having.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:57.000
rebeccaharmon: And so, I just want you all toâ€¦ I'm saying that because I want you all to know that what you're giving us and doing.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
rebeccaharmon: has big impact.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
rebeccaharmon: And I just want to thank you so much for being willing to do it.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
rebeccaharmon: Because, umâ€¦

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:14.000
rebeccaharmon: It's going to make it possible for us to grow this project, and we wouldn't be able to do it if we stick with this paper model that we're doing.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
rebeccaharmon: So, I just wanted to say that to you.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Kimberlee Noel: Well, thank you, Becky, and.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, you know, I'veâ€¦ ever since learning about the project, there was noâ€¦

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Kimberlee Noel: Hesitation, um, as far as, you know.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Kimberlee Noel: would I want to work on something like this? It was absolutelyâ€¦

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Kimberlee Noel: Um, yes. Umâ€¦

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Kimberlee Noel: you know, I hope that we canâ€¦

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Kimberlee Noel: Make it as simple.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Kimberlee Noel: And, umâ€¦

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Kimberlee Noel: As useful as possible, so that it does make your efforts to expand the project, um, easy.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah, thank you. I have noâ€¦

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Kimberlee Noel: Yeah, I justâ€¦

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
rebeccaharmon: qualms about it at all. I'm sure they'll be brilliant.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Kimberlee Noel: Mhm.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
rebeccaharmon: and beautiful.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Kimberlee Noel: Alright, well, it was nice meeting you, Becky.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
mark: Awesome.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
rebeccaharmon: Yeah. Yeah, thank you so much, guys.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Kimberlee Noel: Alright, talk to you later.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
rebeccaharmon: Alright. Give Heather, my love.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
mark: Bye-bye.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Kimberlee Noel: Nope, bye.
