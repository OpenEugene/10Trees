🌿 **10 Trees Digital Tracking Platform --- System/Project Overview**

**Main Idea**

The system is built around digital forms used by mentors in the field.

Mentors collect data on their smartphones, and upload it (when
connected) to a central web-based database accessible to the 10 Trees
team at the Centre.

The admin, project manager, and educator can then view and download data
as needed.

**Core Components**

> **A. Users and Devices**

-   **Tree Mentors (Currently 17 total)**

    -   Use small smartphones (mixed brands like Nokia/off-brand)

    -   Collect data offline or with limited data

    -   Upload data at the Centre via Wi-Fi

    -   Continue using WhatsApp for garden photos if easier

-   **Centre Staff (Admin, Project Manager, Educator, ED)**

    -   Access data via laptops at the Centre

    -   Review, export, and aggregate data (Excel/CSV)

    -   Optionally drop map pins during garden visits

**B. Data Flow**

1.  **Application Form**

    -   Completed by mentors on smartphones

    -   Tick-box question + e-signature

    -   Includes "Date left program" and "Reason" tick box

2.  **Mapping Form**

    -   Linked to Application Form (same household)

    -   Optional GPS pin (added later by staff if mentors can't do it)

    -   Optional photo (uploads or WhatsApp integration)

3.  Release Form (Becky to send)

4.  **Garden Assessment**

    -   Completed by mentors twice per month (Year 1), then monthly
        > (Year 2)

    -   Calculates tree survival rate automatically

    -   Tick boxes for problems, dropdown for tree types (or text entry
        > if long list)

    -   "Do you need help with this problem?" added below issues

    -   MED: checkboxes for permaculture best practices

    -   MED: also keep track of the total number.

5.  **Class Attendance (optional for now)**

    -   May remain in Excel rather than integrated into the platform

6.  **Central Database (Web App)**

    -   Stores all digital form submissions

    -   Data organized by Village Tabs (Orpen Gate Village, etc.)

    -   Accessible only to Centre staff (admin, PM, ED, educator)

7.  **Data Reporting/Export**

    -   Downloadable as Excel or CSV

    -   Summary views show:

        -   Total trees planted

        -   Tree survival rate

        -   Use of permaculture principles

    -   No complex visual charts required - numbers and lists only

**Key Notes**

-   All mentors have data plans, but connection quality varies -
    > offline-first or "save and sync later" mode is ideal

-   Photos: continue via WhatsApp unless reliable upload is confirmed

-   Language: English and Xitsonga side-by-side

-   Access Levels: mentors can submit only; staff can view/edit/export

-   Testing: led by Becky, Trygive, and Quentan

Meeting feedback

-   Each village has It's own data

-   Adam's can see all data

-   Generate reports

    -   Tree survival rates

    -   Good principals followed

    -   Area of improvement

    -   See link from Becky (email to mark)

-   Monthly reports

    -   Send to each village

    -   Admin only

-   Data entry challenges

    -   Mentors move between houses

    -   Admin needs to impersonate mentors for data entry

-   Each mentor has 10ish households

-   Screen sizes

    -   What's popular in Africa?

        -   Samsung (Africa)

        -   Nokia (Africa)

        -   IPhones (13ish)

        -   Pep Phones

            -   Please take pictures

        -   \$17 rand = \$1US
