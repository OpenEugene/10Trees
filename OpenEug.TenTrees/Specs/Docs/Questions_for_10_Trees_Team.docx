Questions for 10 Trees Team

**How the System Will Be Used**

1.  Each household already receives a small smartphone - do you know
    which models or screen size they have? They vary quite a bit. Most
    are cheaper versions (Nokia, or off brands)

2.  How well do those phones work for short tasks now (for example,
    filling out WhatsApp forms or viewing photos)? Again, quite
    variable. They don't fill out forms on WhatsApp. They take photos
    and send messages.

3.  Do you think it would work best to:

    a.  Keep using those phones and design the forms to fit small
        screens,

    b.  Get a few shared larger phones or tablets for mentors to help
        households, or

    c.  Use a mix (women answer questions, mentors enter data)? This is
        what happens now. The mentors do the surveys and submit the data
        to our admin person who enters it into an Excel spread sheet.
        Currently there are 17 mentors in Orpen Gate Village.

4.  If new devices might help, how many would make a real difference
    without stretching your budget? We don't have a budget for any new
    devices but maybe we could find someone/some people to donate them.
    It would be great if they all were on the same device.

5.  The Centre has Wi-Fi - is there any mobile data coverage in the
    villages? We provide data for each tree mentor. No one else has
    wifi. Network is a bit sketchy and goes down quite often.

6.  Would it make sense for mentors to collect forms offline and then
    upload them at the Centre, or do some have enough data to submit
    directly from the field? Depends on how much data it will take to
    submit. Right now they turn in their garden assessments at the
    Centre so it could happen there.

7.  Who do you picture actually filling in the forms most often - the
    women, the mentors, or Centre staff helping later? The mentors fill
    in the forms.

**Language, Literacy & Design**

8.  You mentioned wanting as little writing as possible - should every
    question be a simple Yes/No or multiple-choice tick box whenever
    possible? Yes

9.  Who could help with translations once we build the first digital
    version? We have someone on our team that can translate. I can send
    you all of the forms with translation that has already been done.

**Application Form**

10. Can you share the wording for the four extra commitments you'd like
    included? See attached application form

11. For signatures, would it work if we use a simple "I agree" checkbox
    or typed name instead of a written signature? Yes we could use an e
    signature.

12. After submitting, do you want a short confirmation message (for
    example, "Your application has been saved")? If possible that would
    be good.

13. The only other thing I can think of is if we can add a field that if
    they leave the program there is a date they left and a reason why.
    We can probably come up with a list of reasons so it can be a tick
    box.

**Mapping Form**

14. Should the "date" refer to the day the garden was mapped or when the
    form is filled in? These are the same dates.

15. For the location pin, do you imagine mentors dropping it while in
    the garden or later from the Centre's Wi-Fi connection? I'm not sure
    if we can get them to do this. We may have to have one of our staff
    do it when they are doing garden visits.

16. Would an optional photo upload of the plot or trees be useful?

    a.  MED - File uploads are fine as long as the data plan is good.
        They can fail if the images are too big. We might be able to
        shrink them, but if the connection is good, upload are no
        problem. We can keep using Whats App for photos if there is a
        way to load them into each file.

**Garden Assessment**

17. Who usually completes these assessments - mentors or Centre staff?
    Mentors

18. How often do assessments happen (once, or a few times per year)?
    Twice a month for the first year and then once a month year 2.

19. Should we automatically calculate the tree survival rate (trees
    alive ÷ trees planted)? Yes that would be amazing.

20. For "If any died, which ones?" - would you prefer a short text box
    or dropdown list of tree types? We can do a drop down list but we
    have about 41 trees so that might not be possible. We'll have to
    talk about the best way to do this.

21. Can you confirm the list of problems you want tick boxes for - the
    four on the paper form plus "pests eating the plant"? Yes. The pest
    problem is a new add so we don't have that translated yet but I have
    attached the garden assessment with translations.

22. Should we include a small "Do you need someone to help with this
    problem?" question right after the tick boxes? That would be good.

**Class Attendance**

23. How are you currently tracking class attendance - on paper sign-in
    sheets or another way? They sign in on paper sheets and then it is
    transferred to an Excel spread sheet.

24. Would you like attendance to connect directly to each participant's
    record? I think we should discuss how complicated tracking class
    attendance is going to be. We may want to just keep it on an Excel
    sheet vs. in the data base.

25. Should we track attendance for every class, or simply mark when all
    five have been completed?

**Organizing & Viewing Data**

26. When viewing results, would you like separate tabs by village name,
    or one big list with filters? Separate tabs by village name

27. Who should be able to see and edit the data? Project manager, ED,
    admin person, educator

28. What kind of summary is most helpful - total trees planted, tree
    survival rate, attendance progress, or something else? Total trees,
    tree survival rate, use of permaculture principles

29. Would you like a simple visual summary (for example, colored bars
    showing survival rate) or just numbers or lists? I think
    numbers/lists is good enough as long as we can aggregate it.

**Training & Support**

30. How comfortable is your team using online forms now? Not much
    experience with them

31. Who should be our main contact for testing and giving feedback
    before the official rollout? Becky, Trygive and Quentan

32. Who on your team will be teaching/training others how to use the new
    platform? Quentan and Becky are likely.

**Reports**

-   Do you have any grant compliance reports that need to be generated?
    Nothing additional

-   We can provide XLS (Excel) or CSV (generic) downloads for most data
    grids on the app.

-   Knowing the details of the reports helps us verify we are collecting
    the proper data along the way in a format that is easy to report on
    in the end.
