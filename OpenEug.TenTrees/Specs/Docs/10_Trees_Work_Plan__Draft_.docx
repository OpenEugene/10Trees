10 Trees Work Plan

**Phase 1: Getting Ready (November 2025)**

**Goal:** Make sure the new digital system fits how 10 Trees staff and
women in the community actually work.

**Key Actions**

-   Schedule a kickoff meeting

-   Confirm how the forms are currently filled out and collected

-   Review the three paper forms together (Application, Mapping, Garden
    > Assessment)

-   Decide:

    -   Who will fill out the forms (staff, mentors, or beneficiaries)

    -   Whether data will be entered on-site using phones or later at
        > the Centre using WI-FI

    -   What devices are available (phones, tablets, laptops)

-   Identify any training or equipment needs (for example, larger screen
    > phones or shared tablets)

-   Explore any additional features

    -   Adding photos of gardens or trees

    -   Simple offline option for areas with poor signal

**Outcome:**

Clear plan for who collects information, how, and on what device

**Phase 2: Simplify the Forms (November, December 2025)**

**Goal:** Turn paper forms into easy digital versions that can be
completed on a phone.

**Guiding principle:** As few words as possible - mostly tick boxes.

**Key Actions**

1.  **Application Form**

-   Add Y/N questions for:

    -   Owns their home

    -   Signed Release of Information form

    -   Each commitment (including 4 new ones)

-   Separate house number and ID/BD number fields

-   Change "household size" to "number living in the home"

-   Discuss simple ways to "sign" the form (initial, checkbox, or photo
    > of signature)

2.  **Mapping Form (replaces Garden Site Assessment)**

-   Add a date field

-   Link automatically to the Application Form so names/IDs don't need
    > to be re-entered

-   Include a location pin option (staff can drop the pin at the Centre
    > if GPS is difficult in the field)

-   Use village name + plot number instead of full address

**3. Garden Assessment Form**

-   Link to Application form to auto-fill names

-   Add greywater question under "collecting water"

-   Replace "intervention needed" to "Do you need someone to help with a
    > problem?"

-   Add tick boxes for the 4 common problems and one for "pests eating
    > the plant"

-   Include "Trees planted" and "Trees still alive" as numbers and
    > auto-show the survival rate

-   Add a small open field for "Which trees died?"

4\. **Attendance Tracker**

-   Add a simple list or checklist for class attendance linked to each
    > participant

**Outcome:**

Digital draft forms ready to review on a phone

**Phase 3: Testing with the Team (January 2026)**

**Goal:** Make sure the forms work well for staff and participants

**Key Actions**

-   Becky and team test the forms using phones and tablets

-   Check how long each form takes to fill out

-   Confirm that the forms are easy to read on small screens

-   Make adjustments based on what is confusing or hard to use

**Outcome:**

Forms that are simple, clear, and field-ready

**Phase 4: Organizing the Information (January, February 2026)**

**Goal:** Make it easy to find, sort, and understand the data once it's
collected

**Key Actions**

-   Set up tabs or folders by village so staff can see all beneficiaries
    > in that area

-   Ensure each participant's Application, Mapping, Assessment, and
    > Attendance link together

-   Include a simple report view that shows:

    -   Number of trees planted and alive

    -   Attendance status

    -   Notes from assessments

**Outcome:**

One central place to view information for each village or household

**Phase 5: Training & Launch (March 2026)**

**Goal:** Teach the team to use the system and begin using it in the
next planting cycle.

**Key Actions**

-   Becky and team provide a short hands-on training at the Centre or
    > where they feel is best

-   Give printed quick guides with screenshots and tick box examples

-   Practice entering on real application and assessment

-   Officially start using the digital forms for all new participants

**Outcome:**

**Phase 6: Follow-Up (March, April 2026)**

**Goal:** Support the team as they use the system

**Key Actions**

**Outcome:**

Stable, community-owned tool that helps track trees, gardens, and
participation.
