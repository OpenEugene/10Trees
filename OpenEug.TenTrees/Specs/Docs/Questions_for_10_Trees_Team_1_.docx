Questions for 10 Trees Team

**How the System Will Be Used**

1.  Each household already receives a small smartphone - do you know
    > which models or screen size they have?

2.  How well do those phones work for short tasks now (for example,
    > filling out WhatsApp forms or viewing photos)?

3.  Do you think it would work best to:

    a.  Keep using those phones and design the forms to fit small
        > screens,

    b.  Get a few shared larger phones or tablets for mentors to help
        > households, or

    c.  Use a mix (women answer questions, mentors enter data)?

4.  If new devices might help, how many would make a real difference
    > without stretching your budget?

5.  The Centre has Wi-Fi - is there any mobile data coverage in the
    > villages?

6.  Would it make sense for mentors to collect forms offline and then
    > upload them at the Centre, or do some have enough data to submit
    > directly from the field?

7.  Who do you picture actually filling in the forms most often - the
    > women, the mentors, or Centre staff helping later?

**Language, Literacy & Design**

8.  You mentioned wanting as little writing as possible - should every
    > question be a simple Yes/No or multiple-choice tick box whenever
    > possible?

9.  Who could help with translations once we build the first digital
    > version?

**Application Form**

10. Can you share the wording for the four extra commitments you'd like
    > included?

11. For signatures, would it work if we use a simple "I agree" checkbox
    > or typed name instead of a written signature?

12. After submitting, do you want a short confirmation message (for
    > example, "Your application has been saved")?

**Mapping Form**

13. Should the "date" refer to the day the garden was mapped or when the
    > form is filled in?

14. For the location pin, do you imagine mentors dropping it while in
    > the garden or later from the Centre's Wi-Fi connection?

15. Would an optional photo upload of the plot or trees be useful?

    a.  MED - File uploads are fine as long as the data plan is good.
        > They can fail if the images are too big. We might be able to
        > shrink them, but if the connection is good, upload are no
        > problem.

**Garden Assessment**

16. Who usually completes these assessments - mentors or Centre staff?

17. How often do assessments happen (once, or a few times per year)?

18. Should we automatically calculate the tree survival rate (trees
    > alive ÷ trees planted)?

19. For "If any died, which ones?" - would you prefer a short text box
    > or dropdown list of tree types?

20. Can you confirm the list of problems you want tick boxes for - the
    > four on the paper form plus "pests eating the plant"?

21. Should we include a small "Do you need someone to help with this
    > problem?" question right after the tick boxes?

**Class Attendance**

22. How are you currently tracking class attendance - on paper sign-in
    > sheets or another way?

23. Would you like attendance to connect directly to each participant's
    > record?

24. Should we track attendance for every class, or simply mark when all
    > five have been completed?

**Organizing & Viewing Data**

25. When viewing results, would you like separate tabs by village name,
    > or one big list with filters?

26. Who should be able to see and edit the data?

27. What kind of summary is most helpful - total trees planted, tree
    > survival rate, attendance progress, or something else?

28. Would you like a simple visual summary (for example, colored bars
    > showing survival rate) or just numbers or lists?

**Training & Support**

29. How comfortable is your team using online forms now?

30. Who should be our main contact for testing and giving feedback
    > before the official rollout?

31. Who on your team will be teaching/training others how to use the new
    > platform?

**Reports**

-   Do you have any grant compliance reports that need to be generated?

-   We can provide XLS (Excel) or CSV (generic) downloads for most data
    > grids on the app.

-   Knowing the details of the reports helps us verify we are collecting
    > the proper data along the way in a format that is easy to report
    > on in the end.
